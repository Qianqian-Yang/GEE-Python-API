# Google Earth Engine: Python API 

These are files to build a github website hosting the [geohackweek](https://geohackweek.github.io/) Google Earth Engine (Python API) [tutorial](https://geohackweek.github.io/GEE-Python-API). Github automatically renders these files using Ruby to build the website.

Pull-requests to expand on our tutorial content are encouraged. Changes can be made to the markdown files located in the [episodes folder](https://github.com/geohackweek/GEE-Python-API/tree/gh-pages/_episodes)
