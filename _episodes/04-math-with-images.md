title: "Math with Images"
teaching: 25
exercises: 10
questions:
- "What is a reducer and why is it mind-blowing?"
objectives:
- "How do I do operations on stacks of images?"
- "Load datasets and successfully visualize in the GEE API"
- Map a funciton over an image collection
- "Use a reducer to calculate mean slope over an area"
keypoints:
- Reducers take an input dataset and produce a single output. 
--- Never use for-loops in GEE, instead map functions over image collections.
 --- You can't make publication quality images in GEE yet, but visualization functionality is always expanding.
